These are some development tools I'm familiar with:

- ![git][git-badge]

- various static analysis tools associated with the languages named above

## I am adamant about documentation

1. If you are not writing docs at all, then prospectors will assume you are not serious about supporting your hard work.
2. If a 15 year old cannot comprehend your documentation, then you _will_ have on-boarding problems with your consumers or team members.
2. Writing with proper grammar and simple sentences helps *a lot*, especially for readers who are not fluent in the written language you use. Translation tools cannot do much with incoherent sentences.
4. Complex documentation should not be lumped into 1 very long document. People need to easily navigate the information you provide.
